- Hi, Iâ€™m @cmueth!
- This is a page for my 3D printing hobby projects. I keep them in the repositories section
- Most of the projects in the repository have something to do with robots and electronics
- This summer, I aim to successfully complete a bipedal remote-control robot (Smol-Tron), a 3D-printed drone (Buzz-Skill), and a push-button electromagnet. These are works in progress, and you will hopefully see updates to them
