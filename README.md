- Hi, I’m @christianmueth!
- This is a page for my 3D printing hobby projects. I keep them in the repositories section
- Most of the projects in the repository have something to do with robotics, magnetism, lasers, or high-voltage electricity
- I aspire to one day be a successful inventor
- This summer, I aim to successfully complete a bipedal remote-control robot (Smol-Tron), a 3D-printed drone (Buzz-Skill), and a push-button electromagnet capable of 50lb of lifting force (The Click-Magnet). These are works in progress, and you will hopefully see updates to them
- I’m also currently trying to teach myself how to code self-learning systems, in python...
