- Hi, I’m @christianmueth!
- This is a page for my 3D printing hobby projects
- I aspire to one day be a successful inventor
- I’m currently learning how to code self-learning systems, in python...
- This summer, I aim to successfully complete a bipedal remote-control robot, a 3D-printed drone, and an electromagnet capable of 50lb of lifting force. These are works in progress
