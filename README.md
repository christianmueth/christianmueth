- Hi, Iâ€™m @christianmueth!
- This is a page for my 3D printing hobby projects. I keep them in the repositories section
- Most of the projects in the repository have something to do with robots and electronics
- This year, I aim to successfully complete a bipedal remote-control robot (Smol-Tron) and a holographic lens. These are works in progress, and I have some other ideas in my back pocket as well. You will hopefully continue to see updates to them
